# Healthcare-Efficiency-Analytics
A Power BI case study exploring healthcare efficiency metrics
This repository contains a Power BI case study exploring hospital efficiency metrics for **HealthStat**, a fictional consulting company. The project uses real-world healthcare data to uncover insights about patient length of stay (LOS), cost per discharge, and hospital performance.  

## Project Overview  
Healthcare efficiency is critical in delivering high-quality patient care while minimizing costs. This project leverages Power BI to:  
- Analyze key attributes influencing LOS and costs.  
- Identify hospital performance outliers.  
- Develop insightful visualizations and interactive dashboards.  

The final deliverable is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.  

## Key Insights  
- **Hospital for Special Surgery** had the highest Total Discharges (4,515), accounting for 38.35% of all discharges.  
- **Kings County Hospital Center** had the longest Average LOS (12 days), while **NYU Lutheran Medical Center** reported the highest Average Cost per Discharge ($84,601).  
- Extreme severity of illness increased LOS the most, while "Southern Tier" health service area decreased costs significantly.  
- Achieved an Average LOS target of 2.65 days across facilities.  

## Features  
- **Data Modeling:** Connected and transformed raw healthcare data.  
- **Advanced DAX Measures:** Created calculated measures and tables to analyze trends.  
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Used key influencers, outlier detection, and drill-through functionality.  
- **Professional Dashboard:** Incorporated HealthStat branding and user-friendly navigation.  

## File Structure  
- `/data/` - Contains anonymized healthcare datasets used for analysis.  
- `/reports/` - Includes Power BI (.pbix) file with the final report.  
- `/screenshots/` - Visual snapshots of the dashboard and key visualizations.  
- `/docs/` - Supporting documentation for the project.  

## Prerequisites  
- **Power BI Desktop**  
- Basic knowledge of Power BI, DAX, and data visualization principles.
